Welcome to the Green Book Step Study - a study of the Twelve Steps of SAA based on quotes from Sex Addicts Anonymous 1st ed., aka "The Green Book".

The Green Book is published by and can be ordered from the ISO of SAA. You will need a copy of that book and are urged to get one.

Goal: to take people through the 12 steps in 24 worksheets.

The concept is not to give a full, in depth analysis of what the steps are, but to give an overview of what the steps might do.

In the SAA fellowship, there are many different ways to work the Twelve Steps and numerous traditions governing such work. We recommend doing this work with a sponsor who may recommend a specific method. This "Step Study" is one way to work the Twelve Steps of SAA. In this study, we explore the wording of the steps and encourage you to find the meanings of the wordings that fit your life the best and find the method of working the steps that brings you the most spiritual growth.

At this point, it is important to acknowledge the wide variation in our fellowship and the multiple methods of working the steps. The steps are the same, but the specific actions suggested to "work the steps" are different. Your sponsor can guide you in this.

As we explore how the steps affect our lives, working the Twelve Steps in SAA becomes far more than a set of intellectual exercises. The process can be profoundly transforming and we gain new insight into the world around us and new perceptions of how the universe works. Thus, many discussion questions in this study ask us to explore and analyze our experiences in recovery. Some of the experiences in question may be new to you or you might not have had them yet. Hopefully, such questions can open you up to the possibility of such experiences and you may be open to seeing a higher power's actions in a new light.

Recovery does not happen on a preset schedule. While there are only a few exercises for each step, there is no time limit for working that step. We urge you simply to have the commitment to persist in exploring the next step on a regular basis. We are only asked to do as much as we can honestly do and no more. By being honest, our recovery is improved.
