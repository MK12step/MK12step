## Getting Started as a Woman in SAA Meetings

>“Our fellowship is open to women and men, regardless of age, race, religion, ethnic background, marital status, or occupation. We welcome members of any sexual identity or orientation, whether they are gay, lesbian, straight, bisexual, or transgender.”
>— Sex Addicts Anonymous, p. 1-2

### There is help for women who have a sex addiction.  We suggest coming to at least six local meetings or telemeetings within a short period of time before deciding whether SAA is right for you. Be gentle with yourself, and give yourself time to listen to others’ stories and absorb the introductory literature. If you are like us, you did not get to where you are now overnight. It will also take time to become oriented to this program and a new way of thinking and living in recovery.  The Women’s Outreach Committee (WOC) has written a <a href='https://saa-recovery.org/women/womens-welcome-letter/'> WOC welcome letter</a>. It may also be useful.
