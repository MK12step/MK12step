> — Sex Addicts Anonymous, p. 10



### We are an SAA <a href="https://saauk.info"> Sex Addicts Anonymous®</a> group of men and women whose primary purpose is to recover from sex addiction and carry the message of a spiritual awakening as a result of working the twelve steps. We follow guidance in the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) <a href="https://www.alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk/product.do?48951">"Big Book"</a> (although we are not affiliated with AA in any way) and guidance in the <a href="https://saauk.info/en/purchases/purchase?xpurchase%5bid%5d=13">SAA Green Book</a>.

### In the meeting, we avoid group therapy and instead focus on applying the Twelve Steps in our lives. Many of us arrive around 7.45pm to set-up the room and for fellowship prior to the meeting. We are fully self-supporting and there are no fees to pay. Members can make a donation at the meeting to pay for rental space, tea and coffee, if they wish.

### Meeting weekly on Monday from 7:45pm to 9:00pm
