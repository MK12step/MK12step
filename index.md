> “At our meetings, we read SAA literature and share our experience, strength, and hope with each other, focusing on how the SAA program of recovery works in our lives.”
> — Sex Addicts Anonymous, p. 10


We are an SAA [Sex Addicts Anonymous®][saa] group of men and women whose primary purpose is to recover from sex addiction and carry the message of a spiritual awakening as a result of working the twelve steps. We follow guidance in the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) ["Big Book"][big] (although we are not affiliated with AA in any way) and guidance in the [SAA Green Book][green].

In the meeting, we avoid group therapy and instead focus on applying the Twelve Steps in our lives. Many of us arrive around 7.45pm to set-up the room and for fellowship prior to the meeting. We are fully self-supporting and there are no fees to pay. Members can make a donation at the meeting to pay for rental space, tea and coffee, if they wish.

### Meeting weekly on Monday from 7:45pm to 9:00pm

## Update October 2021 ##

Following the easing of COVID restrictions in the UK, we are running a hybrid meeting, in the Quaker Centre and online on Zoom.
